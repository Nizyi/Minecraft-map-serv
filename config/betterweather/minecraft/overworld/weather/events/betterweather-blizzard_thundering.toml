#Better Weather uses a prefix system for what biomes weather is allowed to function in.
# Prefix Guide:
# "#" - Biome category representable.
# "$" - Biome dictionary representable.
# "," - Creates a new condition, separate from the previous.
# "ALL" - Spawn in all biomes(no condition).
# "!" - Negates/flips/does the reverse of the condition.
# "" - No prefix serves as a biome ID OR Mod ID representable.
#
# Here are a few examples:
#1. "byg#THE_END, $OCEAN" would mean that the ore may spawn in biomes with the name space "byg" AND in the "END" biome category, OR all biomes in the "OCEAN" dictionary.
#2. "byg:guiana_shield, #MESA" would mean that the ore may spawn in the "byg:guiana_shield" OR all biomes in the "MESA" category.
#3. "byg#ICY$MOUNTAIN" would mean that the ore may only spawn in biomes from byg in the "ICY" category and "MOUNTAIN" dictionary type.
#4. "!byg#DESERT" would mean that the ore may only spawn in biomes that are NOT from byg and NOT in the "DESERT" category.
#5. "ALL", spawn everywhere. 
#6. "" Don't spawn anywhere.
